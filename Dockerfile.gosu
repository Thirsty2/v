# At this point, this container still runs as root, and any files it creates in bind-mounted
# disk directories will have the root UID and GID, making them difficult to read or even delete
# from normal user accounts.  We change that in the entrypoint script, by adding a user
# with the same UID and GID as we pass in on the 'docker run' command line.
